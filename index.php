            <p>Thanks for looking at my eportfolio! I am originally from Philadelphia,
              PA and went to Northeast High. I was previously working at Wells Fargo
              as a Bank Teller but I am now a Front End Manager at Cousinâ€™s Supermarket.<br><br>
              As a Teller, I developed the skills of building meaningful relationships
              with customers in order to better understand their needs.<br><br> As a Front End Manager,
              I am responsible for 30+ employees in different departments. I provide optimal
              leadership as well as actively assist cashiers in daily operations and customers
              by making sure they have found all the products that they wanted as well as leaving
              the store with complete satisfaction.<br><br>

              I chose MIS as a major because I believe IT will change the world and I am interested
              in a career that focuses on digital innovation.<br></p>
